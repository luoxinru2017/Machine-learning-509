For (1) and (2) below, youâ€™re choosing between two candidates to hire. 
Discuss the pros and cons of choosing one candidate over the other in the following situations.

The figure 1 shows that A has low variance, it is safer to hire A.
For B, the variance is higher, and there would be risk to hire B, but it is also possible that after B is hired, he would always has more than 75 productivity.

The figure 2 shows that for A, the productivity would be probably around 60, and B is more likely to have productivity around 80.
B is better.

For figure 3, the estimation has overestimated the productivity. It is biased.
